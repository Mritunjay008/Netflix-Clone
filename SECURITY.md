## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the details. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and strive to provide regular updates as we work to address the vulnerability.

Please provide the following details in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Impact of the vulnerability (e.g., potential data breach, privilege escalation)
- Any additional information or context that might be helpful

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in disclosing them responsibly.

### Disclosure Policy

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports and address any issues in a timely manner. Once a vulnerability report is received, we will investigate and strive to provide updates every 7 days until the issue is resolved or additional information is needed. 

If the vulnerability is accepted, we will notify you when a fix is ready and include the fix in the next release (if applicable).

If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide a justification for our decision.
